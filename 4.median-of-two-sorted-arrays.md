## [4] Median of Two Sorted Arrays

> There are two sorted arrays **nums1** and **nums2** of size m and n respectively.<br>
> Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be **O(log (m+n))**.<br>
> You may assume **nums1** and **nums2** cannot be both empty.

Take two specific arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, as an example:<br>
以两个具体的数组`nums1`和`nums2`为例：
```
nums1: 1,3,5,7
nums2: 2,4,6,8,9
```
The method which can be thought firstly is that, merging two sorted arrays first, then finding the median of the merged array. <br>
最容易想到的方法就是先将两个有序数组合并，再找出合并后数组的中位数。
```
merged_array: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
median: 5
```
However, as the description in the question, "the overall run time complexity should be **O(log(m+n))**", which means the method above will not meet the time requirement. Thus, we should review this problem in another point of view.<br>
然而，题目中要求“整体时间复杂度应为**O(log(m+n))**”, 这意味着上述方法不满足时间复杂度的要求。因此，我们应当换一个角度去看这个问题。

Considering the fact that the numbers smaller than the median makes up of the smaller numbers from `nums1` and `nums2`, and the numbers bigger than the median makes up of the bigger numbers from `nums1` and `nums2`, we can simplify the original question to finding the cuts of the two sorted arrays. Moreover, since it is easy to find that:

$$
\rm
|smaller\_numbers1|+|smaller\_numbers2|=
\begin{cases}
\frac{|merged\_arrays|}{2} &(even)\\
\frac{|merged\_arrays|-1}{2} &(odd)
\end{cases}
$$
According to the time requirement and other conditions mentioned in the description, the tricks used in the binary search algorithm may help us solve this problem.
